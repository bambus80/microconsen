# Micro Consen Kernel
The Micro Consen kernel is an advanced modular TurboWarp kernel featuring built-in support for a filesystem, account managment, and more!

# Version hierarchy
Major releases of the Micro Consen kernel are marked as new RCs. The current newest RC is **RC Nitrogen**.
- **RC Nitrogen:** `53xx-nitrogen`
- **RC Helium:** `52xx-helium`
- **RC Hydrogen:** `51xx-hydrogen`
- **Alpha/Beta:** `50xx-alpha_` or `50xx-beta_`

# Install
The Micro Consen kernel is contained inside a standalone SB3 which you can download. This will get you the standalone Micro Consen kernel project.

> When updating from an older version of Micro Consen in an already existing project, make sure to update ALL system components (Kernel, MCFD, Batexec etc.)!

# License
The Micro Consen kernel is under the MIT License. The license string is contained in the kernel itself in the `sys//kernel` sprite.

# Contribution
The Micro Consen kernel is mostly a solo project so we'd greatly appreciate to see some help! You can do so by opening a pull request.
